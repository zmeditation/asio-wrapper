 *
 * this head file contain some macros used to verify the compiler and update logs etc.

 * license: www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt
 *
 * Known issues:
 * 1. since 1.2.0, with boost-1.49, compatible edition's st_object::is_last_async_call() cannot work properly, it is because before asio calling any callbacks,
 *    it copied the callback(not a good behaviour), this cause st_object::is_last_async_call() never return true, so objects in st_object_pool can never be reused
 *    or freed. To fix this issue, we must not define ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY macro.
 *    BTW, boost-1.61 and standard edition even with boost-1.49 don't have such issue, I'm not sure in which edition, asio fixed this defect,
 *    if you have other versions, please help me to find out the minimum version via the following steps:
 *     1. Compile demo asio_server and test_client;
 *     2. Run asio_server and test_client without any parameters;
 *     3. Stop test_client (input 'quit');
 *     4. Stop asio_server (input 'quit');
 *     5. If asio_server successfully quitted, means this edition doesn't have above defect.
 * 2. since 1.3.5 until 1.4, heartbeat function cannot work properly between windows (at least win-10) and Ubuntu (at least Ubuntu-16.04).
 * 3. since 1.3.5 until 1.4, UDP doesn't support heartbeat because UDP doesn't support OOB data.
 * 4. since 1.3.5 until 1.4, SSL doesn't support heartbeat because SSL doesn't support OOB data.
 * 5. with old openssl (at least 0.9.7), ssl::client_socket_base and ssl_server_socket_base are not reuable, i'm not sure in which version,
 *    they became available, seems it's 1.0.0.
 *
 * change log:
 * 2012.7.7
 * Created
 *
 * 2012.7.7 - 2016.7.7
 * Beta edition
 *
 * 2016.7.7		version 1.0.0
 * First release
 *
 * 2016.7.17	version 1.0.1
 * Support boost-1.49, it's the minimum version for st_asio_wrapper because of boost::container.
 *
 * 2016.8.7		version 1.1.0
 * Add stream_unpacker to receive native data.
 * asio_server and test_client are now able to start with configurable thread number.
 * Add efficiency statistic for performance tuning, and it can be shut down.
 * Add pingpong test.
 * Move packers and unpackers out of 'include' directory (now in 'ext' directory), they don't belong to st_asio_wrapper library.
 *
 * 2016.8.16	version 1.1.1
 * Fix bug: the last msg will not be re-dispatched if on_msg_handle returned false until new msgs come in.
 * Drop timer TIMER_SUSPEND_DISPATCH_MSG, it's useless.
 * Send more msgs in one async_write call.
 * Fix annotations.
 *
 * 2016.9.4		version 1.1.2
 * Renamed proxy_buffer to auto_buffer.
 * Added a new replaceable buffer shared_buffer.
 * Fix bug: if receive buffer overflow and on_msg() returns false (which means using receive buffer),
 *  st_socket will call on_msg() again and again (asynchronously) for the same msg until receive buffer becomes available.
 *
 * 2016.9.13	version 1.1.3
 * Support optional timers (deadline_timer, steady_timer and system_timer).
 * Split ext/st_asio_wrapper_net.h into ext/st_asio_wrapper_client.h, ext/st_asio_wrapper_server.h and ext/st_asio_wrapper_udp.h.
 * Add virtual function st_server_base::on_accept_error, it controls whether to continue the acception or not when error occurred.
 *
 * 2016.9.22	version 1.2.0
 * Add st_socket::on_close() virtual function, if you defined ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY macro, st_asio_wrapper guarantee this is the
 *  last invocation on this st_socket, you can free any resources that belong to this st_socket, except this st_socket itself, because
 *  this st_socket may is being maintained by st_object_pool, in other words, you will never free an object which is maintained by shared_ptr.
 * Add st_socket::is_closable() virtual function, st_connector need it when the link is broken and reconnecting is taking place, under this
 *  situation, we will never reuse or free this st_connector.
 * Add st_object::is_last_async_call() function, it provide 100% safety to reuse or free an object (need to define ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY macro).
 * Rename all force_close functions to force_shutdown;
 * Rename all graceful_close functions to graceful_shutdown;
 * Rename all do_close functions to shutdown;
 * Rename close_all_client function to shutdown_all_client.
 * Rename ST_ASIO_GRACEFUL_CLOSE_MAX_DURATION macro to ST_ASIO_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_MAX_DURATION.
 * Rename ST_ASIO_OBSOLETED_OBJECT_LIFE_TIME macro to ST_ASIO_DELAY_CLOSE.
 * Change default value of ST_ASIO_FREE_OBJECT_INTERVAL macro from 10 to 60.
 * Drop const qualifier for is_send_allowed() function.
 * Strip boost::bind and boost::ref for standard edition.
 *
 * 2016.10.8	version 1.3.0
 * Drop original congestion control (because it cannot totally resolve dead loop) and add a semi-automatic congestion control.
 * Demonstrate how to use the new semi-automatic congestion control (asio_server, test_client, pingpong_server and pingpong_client).
 * Drop post_msg_buffer and corresponding functions (like post_msg()) and timer (st_socket::TIMER_HANDLE_POST_BUFFER).
 * Optimize locks on message sending and dispatching.
 * Add enum shutdown_states.
 * st_timer now can be used independently.
 * Add a new type st_timer::tid to represent timer ID.
 * Add a new packer--fixed_length_packer.
 * Add a new class--message_queue.
 *
 * 2016.10.16	version 1.3.1
 * Support non-lock queue, it's totally not thread safe and lock-free, it can improve IO throughput with particular business.
 * Demonstrate how and when to use non-lock queue as the input and output message buffer.
 * Queues (and their internal containers) used as input and output message buffer are now configurable (by macros or template arguments).
 * New macros--ST_ASIO_INPUT_QUEUE, ST_ASIO_INPUT_CONTAINER, ST_ASIO_OUTPUT_QUEUE and ST_ASIO_OUTPUT_CONTAINER.
 * In contrast to non_lock_queue, rename message_queue to lock_queue.
 * Move container related classes and functions from st_asio_wrapper_base.h to st_asio_wrapper_container.h.
 * Improve efficiency in scenarios of low throughput like pingpong test.
 * Replaceable packer/unpacker now support replaceable_buffer (an alias of auto_buffer) and shared_buffer to be their message type.
 * Move class statistic and obj_with_begin_time out of st_socket to reduce template tiers.
 *
 * 2016.11.13	version 1.3.2
 * Use ST_ASIO_DELAY_CLOSE instead of ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY macro to control delay close duration,
 *  0 is an equivalent of defining ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY, other values keep the same meanings as before.
 * Move st_socket::closing related logic to st_object.
 * Make st_socket::id(uint_fast64_t) private to avoid changing IDs by users.
 * Call close at the end of shutdown function, just for safety.
 * Introduce lock-free mechanism for some appropriate logics (many requesters, only one can succeed, others will fail rather than wait).
 * Remove all mutex (except mutex in st_object_pool, st_service_pump, lock_queue and st_udp_socket).
 * Sharply simplified st_timer class.
 *
 * 2016.11.20	version 1.3.3
 * Simplify header files' dependence.
 * Yield to Visual C++ 10.0
 * Add Visual C++ solution and project files (Visual C++ 11.0 and 9.0).
 *
 * 2016.12.6	version 1.3.4
 * Compatible edition support c++0x (11, 14, 17, ...) features too.
 * Monitor time consumptions for message packing and unpacking.
 * Fix bug: pop_first_pending_send_msg and pop_first_pending_recv_msg cannot compile.
 *
 * 2017.1.1		version 1.3.5
 * Support heartbeat (via OOB data), see ST_ASIO_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL macro for more details.
 * Support scatter-gather buffers when receiving messages, this feature needs modification of i_unpacker, you must explicitly define
 *  ST_ASIO_SCATTERED_RECV_BUFFER macro to open it, this is just for compatibility.
 * Simplify lock-free mechanism.
 * Optimize container insertion (use series of emplace functions instead).
 * Demo test_client support alterable number of sending thread (before, it's a hard code 16).
 * Fix bug: In extreme cases, messages may get starved in receive buffer and will not be dispatched until arrival of next message.
 * Fix bug: In extreme cases, messages may get starved in send buffer and will not be sent until arrival of next message.
 * Fix bug: Sometimes, st_connector_base cannot reconnect to the server after link broken.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.5.30	version 1.4.0
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Virtual function reset_state in i_packer, i_unpacker and i_udp_unpacker have been renamed to reset.
 * Virtual function is_send_allowed has been renamed to is_ready, it also means ready to receive messages
 *  since message sending is not suspendable any more.
 * Virtual function on_msg_handle has been changed, the link_down variable will not be presented any more.
 * Interface i_server::del_client has been renamed to i_server::del_socket.
 * Function inner_packer and inner_unpacker have been renamed to packer and unpacker.
 * All add_client functions have been renamed to add_socket.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support object restoration (on server side), see macro ST_ASIO_RESTORE_OBJECT for more details.
 * Re-implement heartbeat function, use user data (so need packer and unpacker's support) instead of OOB, now there will be no any
 *  limitations for using heartbeat.
 * Refactor and optimize ssl objects, now st_ssl_connector_base and st_ssl_server_socket_base are reusable,
 *  just need you to define macro ST_ASIO_REUSE_SSL_STREAM.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Before on_close() to be called, st_socket::start becomes available (so user can call it falsely).
 * If a timer failed or stopped by callback, its status not set properly (should be set to TIMER_CANCELED).
 * Make ssl shutting down thread safe.
 * Make reconnecting after all async invocations (like object reusing or restoration).
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Virtual function i_packer::pack_heartbeat been introduced to support heartbeat function.
 * Interface i_server::restore_socket been added, see macro ST_ASIO_RESTORE_OBJECT for more details.
 * Be able to manually start heartbeat function without defining macro ST_ASIO_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL, see demo asio_server for more details.
 * Support sync mode when sending messages, it's also a type of congestion control like safe_send_msg.
 * Expand enum st_tcp_socket::shutdown_states, now it's able to represent all SOCKET status (connected, shutting down and broken),
 *  so rename it to link_status.
 * Enhance class timer (function is_timer and another stop_all_timer been added).
 * Support all buffer types that boost::asio supported when receiving messages, use macro ST_ASIO_RECV_BUFFER_TYPE (it's the only way) to define the buffer type,
 *  it's effective for both TCP and UDP.
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Drop st_server_base::shutdown_all_client, use st_server_base::force_shutdown instead.
 * Drop ST_ASIO_DISCARD_MSG_WHEN_LINK_DOWN macro and related logic, because it brings complexity and race condition,
 *  and are not very useful.
 * Drop socket::is_closable, st_connector_base will overwrite socket::on_close to implement reconnecting mechanism.
 * Not support pausing message sending and dispatching any more, because they bring complexity and race condition,
 *  and are not very useful.
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move heartbeat function from st_connector_base and st_server_socket_base to st_socket, so introduce new virtual function
 *  virtual void on_heartbeat_error() to st_socket, subclass need to implement it.
 * Move async shutdown function from st_connector_base and st_server_socket_base to st_socket, so introduce new virtual function
 *  virtual void on_async_shutdown_error() to st_socket, subclass need to implement it.
 * Move handshake from st_ssl_server_base to st_ssl_server_socket_base.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Use boost::mutex instead of boost::shared_mutex, the former is more efficient in st_asio_wrapper's usage scenario.
 * Move macro ST_ASIO_SCATTERED_RECV_BUFFER from st_asio_wrapper to st_asio_wrapper::ext, because it doesn't belong to st_asio_wrapper any more after introduced
 *  macro ST_ASIO_RECV_BUFFER_TYPE.
 * Move macro ST_ASIO_MSG_BUFFER_SIZE from st_asio_wrapper to st_asio_wrapper::ext, because it doesn't belong to st_asio_wrapper.
 * Use boost::unordered::unordered_map instead of unordered_set, because we used one of the overloaded function find, which is marked as 'not encouraged to use'.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.6.19	version 1.4.1
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix race condition on member variable last_send_msg in st_tcp_socket_base.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Optimize reconnecting mechanism.
 * Enhance class st_timer.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Rename st_connector_base and st_ssl_connector_base to st_client_socket_base and st_ssl_client_socket_base, the former is still available, but is just an alias.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.7.9		version 2.0.0
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * No error_code will be presented anymore when call io_context::run, suggest to define macro ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY.
 * i_unpacker has been moved to namespace tcp, i_udp_unpacker has been moved to namespace udp and renamed to i_unpacker.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Add two demos for concurrent test.
 * Support unstripped message (take the default unpacker for example, it will not strip message header in parse_msg), this feature is disabled by default,
 *  you can call i_unpacker's void stripped(bool) function to enable it.
 *  udp::i_unpacker doesn't have this feature, it always and only support unstripped message.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix reconnecting mechanism in demo ssl_test.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Truly support asio 1.11 (don't use deprecated functions and classes any more), and of course, asio 1.10 will be supported too.
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Drop standard edition, use ascs (https://github.com/youngwolf-project/ascs) instead, it doesn't depend boost, but can work with boost.
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Rename the name of classes and header files according to ascs, relocate header files according to ascs, macros been kept.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Use mutable_buffer and const_buffer instead of mutable_buffers_1 and const_buffers_1 if possible, this can gain some performance improvement.
 * Call force_shutdown instead of graceful_shutdown in tcp::client_base::uninit().
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.7.23	version 2.0.1
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * i_server has been moved from st_asio_wrapper to st_asio_wrapper::tcp.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support decreasing (increasing already supported) the number of service thread at runtime by defining ST_ASIO_DECREASE_THREAD_AT_RUNTIME macro,
 *  suggest to define ST_ASIO_AVOID_AUTO_STOP_SERVICE macro too.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Always directly shutdown ssl::client_socket_base if macro ST_ASIO_REUSE_SSL_STREAM been defined.
 * Make queue::clear and swap thread-safe if possible.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Optimized and simplified auto_buffer, shared_buffer and ext::basic_buffer.
 * Optimized class obj_with_begin_time.
 * Not use sending buffer (send_msg_buffer) if possible.
 * Reduced stopped() invocation (because it needs locks).
 * Introduced boost::asio::io_service::work (boost::asio::executor_work_guard) by defining ST_ASIO_AVOID_AUTO_STOP_SERVICE macro.
 * Add function service_pump::service_thread_num to fetch the real number of service thread (must define ST_ASIO__DECREASE_THREAD_AT_RUNTIME macro).
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move all deprecated classes (connector_base, client_base, service_base) to alias.h
 * Refactor the mechanism of message sending.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Rename tcp::client_base to tcp::multi_client_base, ext::tcp::client to ext::tcp::multi_client, udp::service_base to udp::multi_service_base,
 *  ext::udp::service to ext::udp::multi_service. Old ones are still available, but have became alias.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.9.17	version 2.0.2
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Function object_pool::invalid_object_pop only pop obsoleted objects with no additional reference.
 * socket::stat.last_recv_time will not be updated before tcp::socket_base::on_connect anymore.
 * For ssl socket, on_handshake will be invoked before on_connect (before, on_connect is before on_handshake).
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * If start the same timer and return false in the timer's call_back, its status will be set to TIMER_CANCELED (the right value should be TIMER_OK).
 * If call stop_service after service_pump stopped, timer TIMER_DELAY_CLOSE will be left behind and be triggered after the next start_service,
 *  this will bring disorders to st_asio_wrapper::socket.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * During congestion controlling, retry interval can be changed at runtime, you can use this feature for performance tuning,
 *  see macro ST_ASIO_MSG_HANDLING_INTERVAL_STEP1 and ST_ASIO_MSG_HANDLING_INTERVAL_STEP2 for more details.
 * Avoid decreasing the number of service thread to less than one.
 * Add a helper function object_pool::get_statistic.
 * Add another overload of function object_pool::invalid_object_pop.
 * Introduce asio::defer to object, be careful to use it.
 * Add link's break time and establish time to the statistic object.
 * Move virtual function client_socket_base::on_connect to tcp::socket_base, so server_socket_base will have it too (and ssl sockets).
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Drop useless variables which need macro ST_ASIO_DECREASE_THREAD_AT_RUNTIME to be defined.
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move variable last_send_time and last_recv_time from st_asio_wrapper::socket to st_asio_wrapper::socet::stat (a statistic object).
 * Move common operations in client_socket_base::do_start and server_socket_base::do_start to tcp::socket_base::do_start and socket::do_start.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Always use io_context instead of io_service (before asio 1.11, io_context will be a typedef of io_service).
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.9.28	version 2.0.3
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * Support unmovable buffers (for example: a very short std::string).
 * Eliminate race condition in udp::socket_base.
 * Eliminate race condition in demo file_client.
 * Avoid division by zero error in demo file_client.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.12.25	version 2.0.4
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support boost-1.66
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix race condition when controlling the number of service thread at runtime.
 * Fix compiler warnings.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Add verification for object allocation.
 * Add log if stop_timer failed.
 * Hide variable server in server_socket_base, use get_server function instead.
 * A boolean value instead of void will be returned from set_timer and update_timer_info.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move function show_info from server_socket_base and client_socket_base to tcp::show_info.

//   on the server side) after reconnected to the server;
